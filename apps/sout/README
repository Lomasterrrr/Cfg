Console application manager for linux like dmenu; supports search and
3 output modes, very fast. For compilation you just need to run Makefile
in the root folder, i.e. in the folder with sout.c.

! The ncurses library is required for compilation.

1. (l) Line mode for one line search:

  : firef

2. (ll) Long mode for searching in multiple lines:

  loaded 11608 files from 6 paths (2.95 GiB)
  exec /usr/sbin/firefox (45.00 B) 4
  : firef
  ------------------------------------
  zipinfo
  zmf2raw
  zmf2svg
  ...,

3. (s) Short mode is the same as long mode, only without the prompts:

  loaded 11608 files from 6 paths (2.95 GiB)
  exec /usr/sbin/firefox (45.00 B) 4
  : firef

4. (r) Random mode to select a random mode from the {line, long} set:

  ????
  ????

To set it in i3 you can make a bind like this,
  bindsym $<key> exec --no-startup-id <your terminal> <path to sout> <mode>.

For example, I have it set like this,
  bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id kitty /home/lomaster/sout/sout -m ll -p "/bin,/sbin"
